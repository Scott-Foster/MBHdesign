* A robust scientific conclusion is the result of a rigorous scientific process. In observational ecology, this process involves making inferences about a population from a sample. The sample is crucial, and is the result of implementing a survey design. A good survey design ensures that the data from the survey are capable of answering the research question. Better designs, such as spatially balanced designs, will also be as precise as possible given the constraints of the budget.


* Many study areas will have previously sampled ‘legacy sites’ that already have accumulated a time series of observations. For estimating trent, it is often beneficial to include these sites within a new survey. In this paper, we propose a method to incorporate the locations of legacy sites into new spatially balanced survey designs to ensure spatial balance among all sample locations.


* Simulation experiments indicate that incorporating the spatial location of legacy sites increases spatial balance and decreases uncertainty in inferences (smaller standard errors in mean estimates) when compared to designs that ignore legacy site locations. We illustrate the process of incorporating legacy sites using a proposed survey of a large marine reserve in South-Eastern Australia, although the method is applicable to all environments.


* Our approach allows for integration of legacy sites into a new spatially balanced design, increasing efficiency. Scientists, managers and funders alike will benefit from this methodology – it provides a tool to provide efficient survey designs around established ones, including in-the-field adjustments. In this way, it can aid integrated monitoring programmes. An R-package that implements these methods, called MBHdesign, is available from CRAN.

  abstract = {Abstract Many sampling techniques rely on taking measurements along a transect; an example is underwater imagery from towed platforms used for marine ecological studies. Despite transect-based sampling being commonly used, methods to generate randomized survey designs have not hitherto been developed. We develop methods to generate random transect designs, which respect the user-defined probability of sampling each grid cell (the cell inclusion probabilities). We show how to: (a) define transect inclusion probabilities from user-specified cell inclusion probabilities, which allows particular environments to be sampled more often; (b) alter the cell and transect inclusion probabilities so that when transects are sampled the frequencies of sampling cells approximate the cell inclusion probabilities, and; (c) draw a spatially balanced probability sample of transects. The spatially balanced transect designs approximately maintain the cell inclusion probabilities. The greatest of the small departures occur near the extreme corners of our convex study region, which are difficult to place transects into. The proposed designs also exhibit superior spatial balance compared to the non-balanced counterparts. We illustrate the successful application of the method to a towed-camera survey of deep-sea (500–2,000 m depths) seamounts off Tasmania, Australia. This was a challenging application due to the complex topology of the setting, and uneven inclusion probabilities for the property of interest -- the presence of a stony coral. Our approach develops the randomization approach to transect-based surveys, thereby ensuring that transect-based surveys can enjoy the same benefits as random point-based surveys. The method approximates the cell inclusion probabilities, and does so while spatially balancing the transects throughout the study area. Practitioners can access the methods through the R-package MBHdesign, which is available from CRAN. We anticipate that it will act as a cornerstone for transect-based ecological monitoring programmes.},

  Abstract                 = {A new spatial sampling method is proposed in order to achieve a double property of balancing. The sample is spatially balanced or well spread so as to avoid selecting neighbouring units. Moreover, the method also enables to satisfy balancing equations on auxiliary variables available on all the sampling units because the Horvitz–Thompson estimator is almost equal to the population totals for these variables. The method works with any definition of distance in a multidimensional space and supports the use of unequal inclusion probabilities. The algorithm is simple and fast. Examples show that the method succeeds in using more information than the local pivotal method, the cube method and the Generalized Random-Tessellation Stratified sampling method, and thus performs better. An estimator of the variance for this sampling design is proposed in order to lead to an inference that takes the effect of the sampling design into account.

Two sampling schemes are discussed in connection with the problem of determining optimum selection probabilities according to the information available in a supplementary variable.

Generally, sample designs that are spatially balanced are more efficient than designs which are not. A spatially balanced design selects a sample that is evenly distributed over the extent of the resource. In this article we present a new spatially balanced design that can be used to select a sample from discrete and continuous populations in multi-dimensional space. The design, which we call balanced acceptance sampling, utilizes the Halton sequence to assure spatial diversity of selected locations. Targeted inclusion probabilities are achieved by acceptance sampling. The BAS design is conceptually simpler than competing spatially balanced designs, executes faster, and achieves better spatial balance as measured by a number of quantities. The algorithm has been programed in an R package freely available for download.},

  Abstract                 = {The spatial distribution of a natural resource is an important consideration in designing an efficient survey or monitoring program for the resource. We review a unified strategy for designing probability samples of discrete, finite resource populations, such as lakes within some geographical region; linear populations, such as a stream network in a drainage basin, and continuous, two-dimensional populations, such as forests. The strategy can be viewed as a generalization of spatial stratification. In this article, we develop a local neighborhood variance estimator based on that perspective, and examine its behavior via simulation. The simulations indicate that the local neighborhood estimator is unbiased and stable. The Horvitz–Thompson variance estimator based on assuming independent random sampling (IRS) may be two times the magnitude of the local neighborhood estimate. An example using data from a generalized random-tessellation stratified design on the Oahe Reservoir resulted in local variance estimates being 22 to 58 percent smaller than Horvitz–Thompson IRS variance estimates. Variables with stronger spatial patterns had greater reductions in variance, as expected. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

However, many environmental problems are not single agency issues that require intervention or monitoring at one spatial scale. A master sample can be used to coordinate and scale monitoring designs to ensure consistency in information gathered and robustness of estimators at the different spatial scales. We propose using balanced acceptance sampling (BAS) to generate a master sample. In this context, practical applications and justification of BAS as a master sample are addressed. These include sample generation, stratification, unequal probability sampling, rotating panel designs, and regional intensification. A method for incorporating legacy sites is also provided. Using BAS as a master sample is conceptually simple, gives good spatial balance over different spatial scales, and is computationally efficient to generate. An example for terrestrial biodiversity monitoring in New Zealand is provided. Environmental monitoring can benefit from increased coordination between agencies. A master sample is an excellent way to incorporate coordination directly into the sample design. BAS improves on methods previously described and provides an effective method to monitor populations at multiple spatial scales.},
